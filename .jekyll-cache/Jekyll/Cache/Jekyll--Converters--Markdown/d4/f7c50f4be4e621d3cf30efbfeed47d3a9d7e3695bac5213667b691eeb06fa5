<h3 id="hello"><span style="color:#36648B">Hello!</span></h3>
<p>How you doing ? I'm very happy to see you here, 
you probably accessed this post because you want to know a little more about this person. So here we go.</p>
<p>My names is Jeiso Pedreira da Silva, I was born in s√£o paulo (Brazil) and lived here my whole life. I started my jorney in information tecnology in 2016 with a degree in Computer Science, after deciding to quit the job I had been working at for 4 years and to venture into uncharted seas.</p>

<p>In mid-2017 when I was already in my internship program, in a conversation about new market trends with my manager, he introduced me to a course called Data Analysis with Python, in which there was an introduction to Data Science with Python: it was passion at first sight.</p>

<p>Since then I have been dedicating myself to learn more every day, and one of the results of this effort was the creation of this blog. Here, my main goal is to share the knowledge I've been acquiring over time and also post content about the libraries I use on a daily basis as well as some tips and gifs. :)</p>

<p><img style="width:500px;margin:30px" src="../../../images/harry_potter.gif" /></p>

<p>Initially I was a Computer Science major at Universidade Nove de Julho, but I went on to study Information Technology Management at Falculdade Impacta de Tecnologia after winning a full scholarship.</p>

<p>Currently I am part of the Data Science team at NielsenIQ, where I try to improve my knowledge by seeking new techniques and solutions every day.</p>

<p>Well that's it, this's me! I hope to see you again here. Follow me on Twitter and be my contact on LinkeIdn. See you!</p>
